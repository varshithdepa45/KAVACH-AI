"""Security middleware for KAVACH AI.

Responsibilities:
    * Record an audit-log entry for every mutating / significant request.
    * Enforce the airgapped outbound-block policy. Since the app makes no
      outbound calls, this middleware asserts that no request carries an
      instruction to reach an external provider and stamps the response with the
      current mode header.

Audit logging is best-effort and never breaks a request.
